## Try It Out

> [!NOTE]  
> Live CD is a new feature and is still in testing.

We are now creating a [Live ISO](https://pub-969fbc86b5f24e4d81c6d022e8fd8dde.r2.dev/blue95-live-latest.iso) that can be used to boot into a Blue95 live environment. Test it out without needing to install anything.

Note that the included installer is an alpha version with many missing features. It is recommended to install Blue95 via the methods listed in the [Install Guide](https://blues.win/95/docs/install).

## Installation

Please follow the [Install Guide](https://blues.win/95/docs/install) in the documentation.

## Project Goals

- Match upstream Fedora Xfce in terms of core system components and update schedule.
- Pull in tweaks from [Universal Blue](https://github.com/ublue-os) (e.g. codecs, automatic updates, etc) to produce a more usable out-of-the box experience.
- Provide an aesthetic rooted in a bygone era of computing.

**Non goals**:
- Faithful reproduction of design elements from decades old operating systems. Whenever usability and exact replication are at odds, usability and accessibility will generally be preferred.
